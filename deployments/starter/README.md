# Starter Stack

> Get your church online with member management, a website, newsletters, and secure password sharing — in about an hour.

## What You Get

| Tool | What It Does | Replaces |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **WordPress** | Church website with sermons, events, contact forms | Wix, Squarespace |
| **ChurchCRM** | Track members, groups, attendance, giving | Planning Center, Breeze |
| **Listmonk** | Send email newsletters to your congregation | Mailchimp |
| **Vaultwarden** | Share passwords securely with staff | LastPass, shared spreadsheets |

**Total cost:** $5-10/month for a small VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr)

## What You Need

- A domain name (e.g., yourchurch.com)
- A VPS with 2GB RAM ($10-12/month) running Ubuntu 22.04
- About 1 hour for initial setup
- Basic comfort with command line (copy/paste is fine)

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get a Server

Sign up for a VPS at [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com), [Linode](https://linode.com), or [Vultr](https://vultr.com).

- Choose **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**
- Choose **2GB RAM** ($10-12/month)
- Choose a location near your congregation

Save the IP address they give you.

### Step 2: Point Your Domain

Log into your domain registrar and create these DNS records pointing to your server IP:

```
www.yourchurch.com      → A Record → YOUR_SERVER_IP
members.yourchurch.com  → A Record → YOUR_SERVER_IP
news.yourchurch.com     → A Record → YOUR_SERVER_IP
vault.yourchurch.com    → A Record → YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS to propagate.

### Step 3: Connect to Your Server

On Mac/Linux, open Terminal. On Windows, use PowerShell.

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Type "yes" when asked about fingerprints, then enter your password.

### Step 4: Install Docker

Copy and paste these commands one at a time:

```bash
# Update the system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Install Docker Compose plugin
apt install docker-compose-plugin -y
```

### Step 5: Download the Stack

```bash
# Create a folder for your church stack
mkdir -p /opt/church && cd /opt/church

# Download the configuration files
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boomertechie/opensource_church_software/main/deployments/starter/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boomertechie/opensource_church_software/main/deployments/starter/.env.example

# Create your configuration file
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 6: Configure Your Settings

```bash
nano .env
```

Update these values:
- Replace `yourchurch.com` with your actual domain
- Replace `CHANGE_ME_X` passwords with strong passwords

To generate strong passwords, open a new terminal and run:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 24
```

Save the file: Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

### Step 7: Start Everything

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for everything to start. Check status with:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

All services should show "running".

### Step 8: Complete Setup for Each Service

## Backups

**Critical:** Set up backups or you will lose everything if your server fails.

Create a backup script:

```bash
nano /opt/church/backup.sh
```

Paste this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
BACKUP_DIR="/opt/church/backups"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup all data
docker run --rm \
  -v starter_wordpress-data:/source/wordpress:ro \
  -v starter_churchcrm-data:/source/churchcrm:ro \
  -v starter_vaultwarden-data:/source/vaultwarden:ro \
  -v starter_listmonk-data:/source/listmonk:ro \
  -v $BACKUP_DIR:/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/church-backup-$DATE.tar.gz -C /source .

# Backup databases
docker exec starter-wordpress-db mysqldump -u wordpress -p${WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD} wordpress > $BACKUP_DIR/wordpress-$DATE.sql
docker exec starter-churchcrm-db mysqldump -u churchcrm -p${CHURCHCRM_DB_PASSWORD} churchcrm > $BACKUP_DIR/churchcrm-$DATE.sql
docker exec starter-listmonk-db pg_dump -U listmonk listmonk > $BACKUP_DIR/listmonk-$DATE.sql

# Keep only last 7 days
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "*.sql" -mtime +7 -delete

echo "Backup complete: $DATE"
```

Make it run automatically:

```bash
chmod +x /opt/church/backup.sh

# Run daily at 2 AM
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 2 * * * /opt/church/backup.sh") | crontab -
```

**Important:** Copy backups offsite! Use `scp` to copy to another computer or set up automatic sync to Backblaze B2 ($5/month for plenty of storage).

## Updates

Update your services monthly:

```bash
cd /opt/church
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Update WordPress plugins through the WordPress admin panel.

## Troubleshooting

### "Site can't be reached"

```bash
# Check if services are running
docker compose ps

# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs wordpress
docker compose logs traefik
```

### "SSL certificate error"

Wait 5 minutes — certificates take time to generate. If still failing:

```bash
# Check Traefik logs
docker compose logs traefik

# Verify DNS is pointing to your server
dig +short www.yourchurch.com
```

### "Forgot my password"

For WordPress, Listmonk, or ChurchCRM — use their built-in password reset via email.

For Vaultwarden admin token — it's in your .env file.

## Next Steps

When you outgrow this stack:

- **Need file sharing?** → Graduate to Small Church Stack (adds Nextcloud)
- **Need video calls?** → Graduate to Privacy-First Stack (adds Jitsi)
- **Need monitoring?** → Add Uptime Kuma to get alerts when things go down
